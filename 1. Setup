Typical Haskell newcomer from other languages like C#, PHP, or Java faces a well-known tooling problem. The language ecosystems supported by major companies like Google or Microsoft have excellent IDEs that can be installed and run within a reasonable time and mouse clicks. You download an installer from the Internet, and it's almost over. But Haskell is a different beast. Thank God the convenience of using Haskell has grown almost to the expectations of spoiled Windows users, but... almost. You have to install separate tools with strange names, each installation may require using a command prompt, and the result is not guaranteed. If you copy-paste everything from our GitHub page without errors, you may still spend a few hours figuring out why nothing works. This refreshing feeling of self-stupidity may repel from Haskell even most seasoned coders, but let's try. Maybe this time we'll succeed. But if not, don't worry. Almost 60 years ago, Harvard University Center for Cognitive Studies released a technical report entitled "Programmanship, or How to Be One-Up on a Computer without Actually Ripping out Its Wires."
